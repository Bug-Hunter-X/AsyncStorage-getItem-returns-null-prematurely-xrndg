This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and attempting to retrieve data before it has been fully stored.  The `getItem` method returns `null` prematurely because the asynchronous operation hasn't completed yet. This often leads to unexpected behavior or crashes further down the line because the app tries to use `null` as if it were valid data.

```javascript
// buggy code
AsyncStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(userData));
const storedUser = await AsyncStorage.getItem('user');
console.log(storedUser); // might log null, causing issues
```
